#Create a Pod named multi-container-pod in the default namespace with two containers:
#The first container named nginx should use the nginx:latest image and expose port 80.
#The second container named logger should use the busybox:latest image and continuously print logs from the nginx containerâ€™s /var/log/nginx directory every 5 seconds.
#Ensure the logger container has access to the logs directory of the nginx container.
#Confirm the pod is running and validate the logs are being printed from the nginx container by the logger.
#
# ! share the volumes between containers. 
#
# to test one can run this: 
#
# k exec -it multi-container-pod -- /bin/sh 
# > echo "test" > /var/logs/nginx/access.log
# k logs multi-container-pod -c logger
